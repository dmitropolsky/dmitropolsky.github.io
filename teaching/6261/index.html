    <p><b>Administrative Notes:</b> <br>
      This course can be used as a theory elective for the PhD program
      in computer science, as a track elective for MS students in the
      "Foundations of Computer Science" track or the "Computer
      Security" track, as a foundations track elective for
      undergraduates following the old curriculum, or an elective for
      undergrads following the new curriculum. 

        
      COMS E-6261 Advanced Cryptography focuses around a different
      topic, possibly with a different format, every time it is taught.
      The class can be repeated for credit.
      Auditing the class is certainly possible but requires instructor
      approval.
      

    
</p><p><h2>Prerequisites</h2>
 COMS-W4261 Introduction to Cryptography  or 
  COMS-W4236 Introduction to Computational Complexity or instructor
    approval.   The most important prerequisite is mathematical
  maturity, and comfort with (preferably also strong affection for)
  rigorous definitions and proofs.  
</p>


<p> <h2>Motivation and Course Description</h2>
     
Many cryptographic primitives trivially imply that NP is hard in the
  average case, but we do not know how to show that even the weakest
  of these (one-way functions) exist given the assumption that NP is
  hard on average. A step towards resolving this fundamental problem
  is to show that cryptography implies hardness of problems weaker
  than NP. An important source of such problems is TFNP, the class of
  search problems that are total, namely every input is guaranteed to
  have a solution, and where a solution can be efficiently verified.
  Examples include factoring an integer, finding a Nash equilibrium,
  or finding a collision for a circuit that has fewer outputs than
  inputs. TFNP is believed to be NP-intermediate, i.e. not in P, but
  not NP-hard.
  <p>
  In this course we will survey the new and burgeoning
  field of cryptography &#8745; TFNP, exploring the connections between
  cryptography and the complexity of total search problem. We will
  also consider connections to meta-complexity. There will be an
  emphasis on open problems and research techniques.

  <p> 

    This course is an advanced graduate level seminar, where most
    lectures will be given by students taking the class (with prior
    feedback and support from the instructors and fellow students).
    The specific papers covered will be selected by the instructors,
    biased by their interests, and (especially for the later lectures)
    also by the interests of the students taking the class.

    
    <h2 id="readings">Lectures and Readings</h2>

    <ul> <li><b> Lecture 1 (1/18): </b> Introduction and class overview.  Tal
    gave a quick intro to crytography, including an overview of
    Impagliazzo worlds and definitions of OWF, OWP, CRHF, and IO.  Dan
    gave a quick intro to total function complexity, including
    definitions of FP, FNP, TFNP, showed that TFNP does not have an
    NP-hard problem unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses, and
    started giving examples of problems in (and not in) TFNP. Talked
    about defining TFNP problems through combinatorial existence
    theorems: defined PIGEON and WEAK-PIGEON (based on pigeonhole
    principle) and the associated classes PPP and PWPP.  Started
    talking about a graph theoretic theorem that can be used to define
    problems and associated classes in TFNP (PPA, PPAD, PLS, and even
	PPP) -- as we will see next time.

      <li><b> Lecture 2 (1/25): </b>
	<ul> <li>Part 1: Dan continued from last time.  Showed a proof that PWPP-p(n) (finding collisions for circuits that shrink a longer poly(n) input string to a shorter n bit string) is equivalent to PWPP (finding a collision for circuits with input length = output length+1) - this generalizes a statement we saw last time.
	    Continued discussing how to make a TFNP problem out of the graph-theoretic existence theorem (an undirected acyclic graph with a vertex of degree 1, has another vertex of degree 1).  We discussed several attempts and variations/special cases, giving rise to different TFNP subclasses. Specifically,  PPA via "END-OF-UNDIRECTED-LINE", a variation that is equivalent to PIGEON (thus gives PPP), PPAD via END-OF-LINE problem, PLS via ITER problem.  We said that PPAD is a subset of PPA intersect PPP. We defined two more problems that turn out to be complete to PPA (in addition to the END-OF-UNDIRECTED-LINE): ODD-DEGREE and LONELY (aka PAIRING).

	  </li>
	  <li> Part 2: <b> Yuriko Nishijima</b>, with support from Akash Kumar, presented on where factoring fits within TFNP.  She prepared a presentation on the main points from the following two papers:
	    <ul>  <li> <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~bureshop/factor.pdf" target="_blank">On the TFNP complexity of factoring</a>, Buresh-Oppenheim </li>
	      <li>
		<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.5220.pdf" target="_blank"> Integer factoring and modular square roots</a>, Jerabek </li>
	    </ul>
	    However, given time constraints, she only ended up covering the first paper showing that factoring specific types of integers is in PPA, and (for more general integers) in PPP with randomized reductions. She also gave a more general overview of what is known.  We will discuss some of the more general results from the second paper next time.

	<ul> <li> Part 1:  <b> Akash Kumar</b>, with support from
	    Yuriko Nishijima, presented the result from Jerabek's
	    paper, showing that (general) factoring can be randomly
	    reduced to PWPP (the paper also shows this for PPA).

	    known about TFNP and crypto, including some things we will
	    see later in the class, to help contextuealize the class
	    topic. She also discussed some open problem and areas for

    <li><b> Lecture 4 (2/8): </b>
      <ul> <li> Part 1: <b>Shouqiao Wang</b>, with support from Hugo Bucquet, presented a
	  result placing discrete log in TFNP. In particular, 
	  DLOG<sub>p</sub> for a prime p is in (but not likely to be
	  complete for) PWPP, while for general groups (with a group
	  operation given by a boolean circuit), two different ways to
	  formulate the problem so that it is total, result in two
	  different complexities:  one (INDEX) that is complete for
	  PPP, and one (DLOG) that is complete for PWPP. Some open
	  problems were also mentioned.

      <li> <b> Lecture 7 (2/29):</b>
	<ul>
	  <li> Part 1:  
	    We started our next unit -- hardness of PPAD (and related classes) from cryptography.
	    Dan gave several definitions and preliminaries.  He
	    defined PPAD and PPADS (via END-OF-LINE problem, where in
	    PPADS a sink must be given, while in PPAD either a sink or
	    another source), as well as PLS (via the SINK-OF-DAG problem,
	    which is equivalent to ITER that we saw in Lecture 1). He
	    then defined SVL -- Sink-Of-Verified-Line -- a promise
	    problem (not total) which is reducible to
	    PPAD &#8745; PLS (so, if there's a way to generate
	    yes-instances of SVL that are hard to solve, then both
	    PPAD and PLS are also hard on average).  Dan showed this
	    reduction -- how to transform a yes-instance of SVL to an
	    instance of PPAD (or of PLS) in a way that a solution to
	    the PPAD (PLS) instance will give a solution to the SVL
	    instance. Intuitively, the main problem is that in SVL the
	    given instance includes only a way to go forward one step, and a way to verify a given
	    node (n-bit-string) is T steps away, but it's not clear how to go
	    backwards (nor how to compute a node that is T steps away
	    efficiently). In contrast, for END-OF-LINE instance we
	    need both a successor and predecessor circuits.  
	    The main technique in the reduction used a pebbling game, where
	    each step is reversible, and where we can show that with t
	    pebbles we can reach a point in location 2<sup>t</sup>-1.
	    This allows to transform the SVL instance to an END-OF-LINE
	    instance, where the each node in the new graph consists of all
	    the t=log T pebble locations (together with  
	    the corresponding n-bit strings that can be used to verify
	    this location).  The  fact that each step in the pebbling
	    game is reversible allows to create both a successor and a
	    predecessor circuit (as well as to create a "cost"
	    circuit, which is which stage we are in in the pebbling
	    game, if we want a reduction to PLS).
	    <p> 
	    We noted that this reduction produces an instance with a
	    <i>unique</i> solution (namely, SVL reduces to UEOPL),
	    which is much more structured (harder/lower/contained in)
	    PPAD  &#8745; PLS. 
	    <ul> <li>  Here are <a href="lecture-notes/L7-2024-2-29-Mitropolsky-Malkin.pdf"
		target="_blank">Dan's notes</a>.</li> 
	    </ul>
	    <p> 
	    In the next few lectures we will see how various
	    crytpographic assumptions imply that we can generate hard
	    promise-true intances of SVL (which in turn imply
	    hardness-on-average of UEOPL and  thus also of PPAD and PLS). 
	  </li> 
	  <li> Part 2:  Miranda discussed the project -- note that the
	  proposal is due next Tuesday! (see more details on
	  the  <a href="projects/" targt="_blank">project page</a>). 
	  We have
	  <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/hpdwyjvdygvj#8d3d89"
	  target="_blank">an evolving document with project ideas</a>
	  -- Miranda went over several of these in class. Even if you
	  don't pick any of these suggestions (which is absolutely
	  fine!) this may help give you some ideas about types of
	  questions and possible scope. 
	  </li>
	  <li> There's no quiz this week, but be sure to submit the
	    project proposal on gradescope by Tue March 5th, and review
	    Dan's lecture and especially the definition of SVL prior to  next week.

	    Unconditional hardness of PLS in the ROM: the second half
	    of the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/013"
	    target="_blank">Bitansky-Gerichter paper on complexity of
	    local search</a>.  This paper uses a technique from blockchain --
	    incremental proofs of work -- to prove hardness of PLS in
	    the random oracle model!  It's also one of the only papers
	    showing hardness of something easier than than rSVL, which
	    is something we're always interested in doing, as it gives
	    the hope of starting with easier crypto assumptions!    
 
	    The paper is related to the teqhnique we saw last week
	    (Lecture 9) and the associated quiz, making an observation
	    about how a relaxation of it - incrementally verifiable
	    computation without uniqueness - is sufficient for PLS
	    hardness.
	    We want to present only the second half of the paper, not
	    the instantiations in the plain model from computational
	    assumptions, but yes the unconditional instantiation in
	    the ROM -- this is the part taken from blockchain
	    techniques.

	       target="_blank">Rosen-Segev-Shahaf's Can PPAD Hardness

	       This is an important paper giving us partial answers on
	       the big questions we've been thinking about in this
	       class:  (1) can we base rSVL hardness on OWF? and (2)
	       what about basing OWF on rSVL hardness? (this is one of

	       TFNP+weaker crypto direction!  all these are problems
	       discussed in class and in the open problems document we

	    classes?  This will not be very technical or a specific

	    with some motivation (it will also be a shorter segment).

This paper tries to answer a question that has been on many of our
	    minds: what about TFNP hardness from LWE? While they don't
	    answer this question exactly, they show how hardness of a
	    related lattice problem (c-SIS) is equivalent to PPP
	    hardness! At the heart of this is a very elegant reduction
	    from circuit computation to a matrix equation.

	       particularly important one is range avoidance, based

    <h4> Topic 5: From OWFs to TNFP hardness </h4>
    <p>
    iO, and even the other assumptions that have been used to
    construct hard TNFP instances, are quite strong. Can we hope to
    show TFNP hardness from the most basic cryptographic primitive:
    one-way functions?  Some negative results (black box separations
    of a certain kind) are known:

    <h2 id="requirements">Class Requirements</h2>
    The class requirements and  their relative weight in the
    grade are as follows: 
    <ul>
      <li> <b> Lecture Presentation and Support (40%): </b> 
	Each weekly meeting will be divided into two lectures of about 50
	minutes each, and most lectures will be delivered by
	students. There will be 1 or 2 students in charge of the
	lecture (presenting the assigned papers to the class), and 1
	or 2 students  supporting the presenter(s).
	Every student is expected to take the role of a presenter
	twice and the role of a supporter twice throughout the
	semester. See <a href=#presentations> additional details on lecture presentations </a> below.
	</li> 

      <li> <b> Quizzes (10%): </b>
	Every week, there will be a short, auto-graded quiz on
	gradescope.   This is meant to be a simple, easy quiz, to check
	that students have been paying attention and understood the
	main take-home messages of the lectures. The quiz should be
	taken individually by every student, without collaboration. 
      </li>
      
      <li> <b> Attendance, Participation, Homework (10%): </b> 
	Students are expected to be present in lectures (physically,
	but not only), and are encouraged to particpate. 
	There may also be a small number (between 0 and 2, likely
	closer to 0) of  homeworks. </li> 

    </li><li><b id="projects"> Project (40%): </b> 
       Every student should complete a research project on any cryptographic
 topic of their choice, subject to instructor approval.   
  Students may work on their research project individually or in a
  group. 
  If you would like to collaborate with others outside the
  class, e.g., other professors or fellow students, you may do so,
  provided that all your collaborators know and approve, and that 
  you're not getting double credit for the same project (and of
  course,  we will hold you accountable for your project).   
  More information about the requirements, deadlines, and suggested
  topics for the projects is available on the
  <a href="projects/">projects page</a>.
<!--  Each project will be presented to the class, either during the final
  exam slot for the class, or during a scheduled day on reading week.-->
</li>
</ul>
Overall, we plan to grade generously, but what you get from the class
in terms of the class goals -- learning of and exposure to the topics
covered, research, and teaching --  is proportional to how much you put
into it (and for the learning part, also proportional to how much your
fellow students and teaching staff put into the teaching part). We hope
for an intimate, fun class, where everyone puts forth their best effort.  
</p>


<h2 id="presentations"> Lecture Presentation Details </h2>

The team of presenter(s) and supporter(s) will work together to
thoroughly understand the assigned paper, and plan how to
teach it effectively. Motivation and context, as well as
definitions, proofs, techniques, and open problems, are all
important -- the team, with  guidance and feedback from the
teaching staff, should plan the right balance in teaching
their particular topic to the class. 

<ul>
<li> <b>  Presenter(s):</b> have to read the paper carefully, think about 
  the right way to teach it to the audience, how to structure their 
  presentation, what to include and not include in the given time (some 
  papers may be quite long), what the main message is, and determine 
  the mechanism they prefer (slides or blackboard).  They should also answer student questions during the lecture. 
</li>
<li> <b>  Supporters(s):</b> have to read the paper carefully, and meet with
  presenters prior to their lecture to go over the presentation and give
  feedback (generally, the presenters should share their preliminary slides or lecture
  notes with the supporters for feedback at least a day before the class they are teaching).
  Supporters should be generally available over email to answer presenters' questions prior to the lecutre, and prepared to help answer stduents' questions during the lecture if needed. 
</li>
<li> <b>  Meeting with instructors:</b> the team will receive an email with 
  instructions and recommendations from an instructor a week before their 
  presentation. The team will then need to meet with the other instructor prior
  to their presentation for feedback.
</li>
<li> <b>  Materials:</b> the team should also provide materials for 
rest of the class, in the form of notes or slides 
summarizing the lecture (again with feedback from the teaching
staff).
</li>
<li> <b>  Overlap:</b> in general, we will try to have the two papers 
  in a given week be thematically related. As such, they may overlap
  substantially in definitions and even lemmas, propositions, etc.
  The second team on any given week has an additional challenge (and benefit):
  they should read the introduction of the first paper to see if there is 
  such overlap, and then coordinate with the other team so that if 
  they will be presenting those definitions or results already, the second
  team knows that they can be much more brief in their presentation of them
  (in general, the second team should at least briefly show those definitions and
  result statements again, but can save time doing so).
</li>
</ul>


<h2> Academic Honesty </h2>


We expect that the primary goal of everyone in the class is to learn (we
can imagine no other reason that you would be in this class).
Hopefully this means that there will be no focus on grades 
(which we can tolerate but discourage in this class), and no issues of
dishonesty (which we absolutely will not tolerate). In particular,
students should take the  quizzes on their own, and be sure to
provide appropriate citations for all sources used in their project
reports,  as well as acknowledgements to other people who
contributed (just as you should do in any academic publishing). 

<p>
As in every CS class, students are expected to adhere to
the <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/honesty"> academic
  honesty policy</a>  of the CS department. This policy has been
passed by the faculty of the Department and approved by the school deans.
