    <h3> Project Requirements and Milestones </h3>
    Students should complete a
    research project on a cryptographic topic of their choice, subject to
    instructor approval (see more about topic selection below). 
    Students may work on their research project individually or in a group.
    If you would like to collaborate with others outside the
    class, e.g., other professors or fellow students, you may do so,
    provided that all your collaborators are mentioned in your report and
    approve this, and that you are not getting double credit for the same
    work (and of course,  we will hold you  accountable for your project).

    <p>
      The first stage of the project will consist of literature study of the
      selected area, and tentative identification of the problem you would
      like to address (what you'd hope to achieve). Over the semester you will
      refine this goal, state a concrete research result
      you hope to obtain, and work towards it.
      Identifying a problem to pursue, making it well-defined, and coming up
      with a plan towards addressing it,  is your responsibility. However,
      you are allowed
      and  encouraged to discuss your ideas with (and receive feedback from) the
      instructors, TA, and fellow students, at all stages (you may also
      incorporate others' ideas  in your project, as long as they are ok
      with it, you give them proper credit, and the project also reflects
      appropriate  effort by each member of the group).

    <p>
      
      Note that the research problem you choose to work on does not have to
      be an open problem that is stated in some paper or identified by an
      expert in the field -- it can be a problem of your own invention.
      It can also be an extension of a known result to new, unknown
      settings. The final report does not need to be a publishable result,
      nor must it conclude in successful resolution. One of the main goals
      of this course is to invoke interesting research ideas, and give you a
      taste of the research process. We encourage interesting projects that
      might end up unsuccessful (as long as all attempts are well documented
      and make sense overall), over a successful resolution of a trivial
      problem.

<p>       While we expect that most projects will not end with a
      publishable result, given the nature of research and the time
      alotted, some might (examples of papers that originated from
      class projects in previous iterations include the following
      papers: .... [give links? about 4 papers I remember)] )
      We suggest that you approach this optimistically: propose a
      concrete research problem, and attack it with the goal of
      solving it.
      In your final report, describe either your new result, or your attempt, 
      where you reached, and what would be the next steps you would
      try if given more time.  

      
    <p>
      Specific milestones and requirements are as follows:
      <ul>
	<li> Proposal: Tue, March 5th 
	</li>
	<li> Progress Report: Tue, April 2  </li>
	<li> Final Report: Wed, May 1. </li>
	<li> Project presentations:  TBA, late April and/or early May
	(options include last lecture, reading week, and/or during the
	final slot for the class). 
	</li> 
      </ul>

    <p>
      More details on what is expected for each of these milestones are
      below.  You are encouraged to consult us early, and submit
      the proposal/progress  reports early, and we will do our best to
      provide early feedback.
      
    <p><b>Proposal:</b>
      The proposal (which can be quite short), should 
      include the following components:  
      <ol>
	<li> Participating group members (one or more) </li>
	<li> General area you'd like to investigate. Optionally,
	  includ the reason that you selected this area. </li>
	<li> Identify an open problem you'd like to solve, or
	  a research result you'd like to achieve. Imagine the best
	  case scenario of you succeeding in your project: what will the
	  abstract of the paper say?  Include the statement of a
	  (conjectured) result you hope to achieve, some motivation for why
	  you think this is interesting, and how this compares to what
	  is known.

	  At this stage the open problem can be open ended
	  (e.g., you could include more than one potential open
	  problem, or a range of possible results parameters, or a
	  "meta" open problem indicating your plan for coming up with
	  an open problem of a certain type).
	</li>
	<li> An initial list of papers you plan to read, or other
	  materials you plan to study. </li>
	<li> Indicate what you plan to complete by the time  you
	  submit your progress  report.
	  Keep in mind that as you explore and study an area (and also
	  as you receive feedback  from us), your plans may shift (you
	  will have a chance to update your plan
	  in the progress report).	</li>
      </ol>

    <p><b>Progress Report:</b>
      The progress report will include the initial project proposal,
      and additionally include updates and refinement on
      points 3 and 5 above.  Specifically, discuss what you've
      learned so far, and what changes you'd like to make to your proposed
      research problem.
      
      At this stage, the open problem you state as your goal should
      be more concrete (for example, a formal statement of a theorem
      you would like to prove or disprove).
      If based on your study so far you think your initial plan is
      not feasible or not interesting, explain why and set a new
      goal which you believe is interesting and achievable within
      the time frame.
      In any case you should outline your planned approach towards
      satisfying your goal based on the progress you've made so far.

      Additionally, describe what you are planning to cover in your
      project presentation.


    <p> <b> Final report:</b>
      Your final report will consist of a paper describing what you have
      achieved.  If you obtained a new research result, state it
      clearly (typically this would take the form of a formal theorem, but
      the main result could also be a new formal model / definition, a 
      description of experimental findings, etc), and include background
      information and motivation.
      If you haven't solved a new open problem (which happens more
      often than not, given the short duration of the project), your
      final report will including a literature survey,
      open  problems, a description of why and where you got stuck,
      and what you learned from these obstacles,
      including a suggestion for the next research steps, and what
      might be obtainable.
      
    <p> Overall, there are two main goals for a project in
      this class, and your final report should demonstrate you have
      progressed on both (although the ratio between the two can vary).
  <ol>
    <li> Acquiring a substantial body of knowledge about the
      topic of your project. This will involve closely and
      carefully reading literature on your specific topic (likely to be
      several papers). You should demonstrate this aspect of your project in
       the  "background" section(s) of your final report, which
      should be a clear synthesis and exposition in your own words of what
      you have learned.</li>
    <li> Gaining research experience in this area; i.e. make a
      serious effort to contribute to the state of knowledge on your
      project topic by  (i) identifying an interesting open question
      or  direction for future research related to your project topic;
      (ii) coming up with a plausible approach to make progress; and
      (iii) working towards delivering on your approach.
      You should demonstrate this aspect of your project by explaining
      in detail your efforts towards (i), 
      (ii) and (iii) in the rest of your final report.</li>
  </ol>

  The ratio of (1) to (2) may vary significantly between different projects.
  There are some projects that might involve relatively less
  background; in that case you will be expected to spend more time, and
  give more evidence of time well spent on the progress made and your
  successful/unsuccessful attempts.
  For other projects, you'll need to acquire more extensive
  background.

    <p> There is no minimum (or maximum) number of papers you have to
      read or pages that you have to write,  though we will try to 
      guide students towards comparable (and reasonable) amount of
      work to complete your project. The 
      expectation from a group will be calibrated to the group size,
      but the rule of thumb is: make an honest effort, start early,
      don't hesitate to request feedback.
      

    <p> <b> Project Presentations:</b>
      Each project will be presented to the rest of the class (during
      the last lecture, or during a designated time in the reading or
      finals week, in lieu of a final for the class). The amount of
      time will be between 15-35 minutes, depending on the number of
      students / projects we have in the class, 
      and the size of the group (as we want each student to
      participate in their project presentation). 

      
      <h3> Project Topics </h3>
      
      The project can be on any topic related to cryptography; 
      it can, but does not have to, fall within the overall theme of the class
      this semester.

      We will add here (coming up soon!) suggested topics and open
      problems.  Many of them will naturally be related to TFNP and
      cryptography, but we will also include other open problems where
      there is interest from students or from the teaching staff.

      As an example, here are some topics  and suggestions published
      in the previous two iterations of the class, just to give you an
      idea. 
      (we will publish updated suggestions here, based on this
      year's topic and student requests).
