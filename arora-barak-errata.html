Errata for Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach (by Sanjeev Arora and Boaz Barak).

<h2> Chapter 19 (Hardness amplication and error-correcting codes)</h2>
<ul>
	<li> pg. 383, top line of page should say the distance might decrease from \(\delta\) to \(\delta/2\).
	<li> pg. 399, Exercise 1 not true as written, should say ask to prove \( \mathbb{P}[X=1] = 1/2 + (-1)^{k+1}(1-2\delta)^k/2 \).
</ul>

<h2> Chapter 21 (Pseudorandom constructions: Expanders and extractors)</h2>
<ul>
	<li> pg. 430, in the proof of Claim 2 the 2nd inequality is missing a factor of \(d\) in the RHS sum, it should say \( \frac{2}{d}\sum_{k=1}^{n/2}d\rho k(\mathbf{v}_k^2 - \mathbf{v}_{k+1}^2) \)
	<li> pg. 430, in the proof of Claim 2 the last line has a typo, it should say \(\frac{2}{d}d\rho \sum_{k=1}^{n/2}k\mathbf{v}_k^2 - (k-1)\mathbf{v}_k^2 = 2\rho\sum_{k=1}^{n}\mathbf{v}_k^2 = \cdots \)
	<li> pg. 434, in the statement of Theorem 21.15 it should say \(|B| = \beta n\) not \(\beta N\)
	<li> pg. 439, at the end of the proof of Claim, the run time is incorrectly given as \(n^{\log 100}\) (\(n\) is not even defined in this Claim). It should be \(100^{\log k}\) which is indeed \(\mathbf{poly}(k)\) as needed
	<li> pg. 441, second paragraph of 21.4.1 should say that \(G_k = (G_{k-1}\circledR H)^{50}\) is a \(d^{50}N\)-vertex graph with degree \(d^{50}\), not \(d\) (though anyway both are constants).
	<li> pg. 441, in the statement of Claim it should say \(G_k\) is a \(d^{50k}n,d^{50},1-\epsilon\) expander, not \(d^{20}\) (though anyway both are constants).
	<li> pg. 445, in Lemma 21.26 it should say \(\Delta(H(X)\circ H, U_m\circ H) < \epsilon\), i.e. \(U_m\) not \(U_n\)
	<li> pg. 448 (TODO) Need to confirm, but Theorem 21.28 is not just a constructive version of 20.7, since I think that proof only gives \(R^{D}(a,x)\) that would be correct on most \(x\), not all.
	<li> pg. 451, in Definition 21.33 the piecewise definition of \(G_k(a\circ z)\) should say \(k=0\) on top and \(k \geq 1\) on the bottom.
	<li> pg. 452, in the proof of Lemma 21.34, the trivial base case is \(k=0\) and not \(k=1\) (credit: Tom Knowles, Apr 2021).
